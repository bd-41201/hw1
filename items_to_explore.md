### Question 1
What would be interesting for us to know from a business perspective, say if we were working for Ben and Jerry's:
<ol>
  <li>What are the factors that describe the average customer (age, race, marital status, etc)</li>
  <li>Do we really need two sizes of packaging? Or could we make more money selling only one size?</li>
</ol>
