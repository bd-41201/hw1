## combine x and y, just to follow my recommended `way to use glm'
## cbind is `column bind'.  It takes two dataframes and makes one.
xy <- cbind(x,y)

## fit the regression
fit <- glm(y~., data=xy) 

## grab the non-intercept p-values from a glm
## -1 to drop the intercept, 4 is 4th column
pvals <- summary(fit)$coef[-1,4] 

## source the fdr_cut function
